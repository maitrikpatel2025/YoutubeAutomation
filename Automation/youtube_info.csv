Hello everyone! Did you know that the color of sindoor or vermillion has a deep scientific significance? It is said to be composed of several minerals, such as mercury, lead, sulfur, and iron oxide, which together have a unique ability to absorb heat from the environment and emit it as infrared radiation. This means that sindoor can help us regulate our body temperature, and keep us cool even during the hottest days of summer!

This fascinating science is embedded in the ancient Hindu mythology of Lord Hanuman. According to the Ramayana, Hanuman thought that if Sita applied a little sindoor on her forehead, it would extend the life of Lord Rama. So he applied sindoor all over his body, and from that day onwards he was known as ?Bajrangbali?, or ?one who is as strong as a thunderbolt?.

The incredible properties of sindoor have been known for centuries, and it?s still widely used by Hindus today in religious ceremonies and during weddings. So the next time you see someone wearing sindoor, remember that it?s not just a sign of beauty - it?s a symbol of scientific and spiritual knowledge from our ancestors!","??? ?? ???????!???? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?????? ?? ????????? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ????????? ????? ????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ?? ??? ??, ???? ?? ????, ????, ????? ?? ???? ???????, ?? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ????? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ?? ??? ??? ????????? ???? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ????? ???? ?? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ??? ????? ??? ?? ???? ??, ?? ???????? ?? ???? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ??!
